              <p>
                I am 2025 Computer Engineering graduate from the National Institute
                of Technology, Kurukshetra. Proficient in C/C++, Python, HTML,
                CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, React.js, Node.js, Express.js,
                MongoDB, and more. I am an avid competitive programmer with a
                CodeChef rating of 1600+ (3‚≠ê), a Codeforces rating of 1235+
                (Pupil), and a LeetCode contest ranking of 1875+ (Knight). I
                have actively participated in multiple hackathons and coding
                challenges. With a comprehensive understanding of algorithms and
                data structures, coupled with strong problem-solving skills, I
                have successfully completed the Coding Ninjas course with
                excellence and contributed as a Teaching Assistant at Coding
                Ninjas. With a robust academic foundation, hands-on project
                experience, and a passion for coding, I am eager to take on new
                challenges and contribute meaningfully to the field of software
                engineering.
